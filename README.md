# Aerotech Robot Arm Repo for Senior Design Fall 2020

This repository serves as the software portion for my capstone engineering project (Senior Design Project). With a group of 3 other students, we will design, prototype, and test a robotic arm that will detect small lenses (11 mm diameter) and move them from an input tray to a target on the assembly line. The arm we are using is the Reactor150X manufactured by Trossen Robotics.
